                <p>Natural oils change your lifestyle inside out. Let’s see how.</p>
                <p>Oils are important and we cannot emphasize enough on the fact that using
                        the pure natural oils can do wonders on your mind, body and soul. Oils used to be an essential
                        part of people’s life since ancient times and continue to be so. The difference however can be
                        observed in the ways that oils were used then vs. now and also in the techniques of extracting
                        these oils. Without further ado, let's dive into the type of oils that our body needs for
                        different purposes.</p>
                <p>First and foremost is the cooking oil. These form the basics of any
                        kitchen. With globalization we might have replaced our traditional oils with olive oil but the
                        benefit of traditional oils cannot be sidelined. Let’s start with the mustard oil.</p>
                <p>Since ancient times, mustard oil has been used to soothe colds, coughs and
                        other respiratory illnesses and allergies. It is a major source of all fats required by our body
                        to perform diverse biological functions as components of plasma, cell lipids and cell membrane.
                        It is also a natural stimulant that is known to stimulate our sweat glands, thereby improving
                        blood circulation throughout the body. Mustard Oil helps to lower body temperature and remove
                        toxins from the body. The Vitamin E in the alpha-tocopherol present in mustard oil has
                        beneficial effects to control diabetic hazards.</p>
                <p>Groundnut Oil: It is really good for people with diabetes. This is
                        because this oil contains more amounts of unsaturated fats than saturated fats, which helps in
                        improving insulin sensitivity and thus regulating the blood sugar levels.</p>
                <p>Sesame Oil: Sesame seed has been beneficial to prevent teeth decay;
                        bleeding gums, dry throat, and for strengthening the teeth, gums and jaw. Sesame oil is rich in
                        antioxidants. They work to neutralize damage done to the body, mostly within the bloodstream,
                        damage caused by viruses, aging and bacteria.</p>
                <p>Coconut Oil: Coconut oil can help you stay in ketosis as it's loaded with
                        fats called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Compared to other fats, MCTs are rapidly absorbed
                        and immediately delivered to your liver. Here, they're either used as a source of energy or
                        converted into ketone bodies.</p>
                <p>Moving on, do you know your skin also requires oil? Well, you must have
                        seen the colorful advertisements promoting moisturizers and creams which have conveniently
                        replaced the original use of oils on our skin to provide nourishment. We will bring you the
                        benefits of using natural oils on your skin.</p>
                <p>Starting with the best: Coconut Oil. Coconut oil acts as a great natural
                        moisturizer for your body. Due to the presence of fatty acids and vitamin E, it provides
                        protection and nourishment to the skin. It acts as a barrier on the skin to hold the moisture
                        inside and prevent dryness of the skin. Regular use of coconut oil gives you perfectly soft
                        skin. </p>
                <p>Rosehip oil: This oil is rich in essential fatty acids and contains
                        vitamins E, C, D, and beta carotene. Chock-full of goodness, it helps to protect and hydrate
                        skin, fight free radical damage, and reduce wrinkles. The vitamins and antioxidants rejuvenate
                        the skin to restore elasticity, correct dark spots, and reduce scars.</p>
                <p>Jojoba Oil: This is similar to our skin’s structure, it can replicate or
                        dissolve oil, depending if your skin overproduces or underproduces oil. Thus, it can help
                        balance out sebum production and eliminate acne. This oil also works as an emollient to soothe
                        skin and provide all-day moisture.</p>
                <p>Now, we know what to do to pamper our skin, let's get going with Hair
                        Oils. Many of us face several problems like hair fall, receding hairline, dryness etc. when it
                        comes to hair heath. We will tell you which all hair oils can prove to be elixir for your
                        hair!</p>
                <p>Almond oil: Almond oil helps to control itchy dandruff, inflamed scalp,
                        prevent hair fall, and strengthen your hairs. Almond oil is rich in vitamin E which acts as an
                        antioxidant. Antioxidants help to neutralize free radicals which can damage your hair. It works
                        to fill the gaps in your hair, which contributes to smoother and softer hair over time. Almond
                        oil is an emollient, meaning it can fill
                        in gaps in your hair at a cellular level. That makes your hair feel smoother to the touch. Using
                        almond oil on your hair gives it a softer texture over time. Once almond oil is incorporated
                        into your hair care routine, you may also notice that your hair is easier to comb through and
                        style.</p>
                <p>Coconut Oil- Coconut oil could help you grow your hair longer by
                        moisturizing your hair and reducing breakage, protecting your hair from protein loss and damage
                        when wet &amp; protecting your hair from environmental damage like wind, sun and smoke. It adds
                        shine to your hair and acts as a wonderful mask.</p>
                <p>To get the most out of coconut oil, you’ll probably need to make it a
                        regular part of your beauty regimen.</p>
                <p>Argan oil- Argan oil has smaller molecules than other most other hair
                        oils, meaning it can penetrate the hair cuticle more effectively. When the oil's nutrients are
                        absorbed better, the hair is softer, making it less prone to tangling.</p>
                <p>There are many factors which negatively affect your lifestyle. One of the
                        key reasons is stress. Essential oils are really helpful in giving your lifestyle a boost, let's
                        see how!</p>
                <p>Essential Oils: Essential oils are often used in aromatherapy, a form of
                        alternative medicine that employs plant extracts to support health and well-being. Using
                        essential oils during a massage helps to relieve stress, although the effects may only last
                        while the massage is taking place. Recent studies have also observed reduced headache after
                        applying peppermint and lavender oil to the skin. Smelling lavender oil has shown to improve the
                        sleep quality of women after childbirth, as well as patients with heart
                        disease.</p>
                <p>Now, this is not it. The essential oils can also replace the artificial
                        air fresheners at your home and save you the trouble of buying those toxic fragrances which add
                        to allergies, asthma and what not. These can be cost effective too!</p>
                <p>And don’t forget, using these oils during meditation helps in
                        concentrating better and creating a pleasant mood.</p>
                <p>All these oils work best when extracted using Cold Pressed Technique. This
                        technique retains the nutrients and properties of natural products and provides you the maximum
                        benefit. We hope that this levels up your daily regime and you add these to your shelf at the
                        earliest.</p>
                <p>Vishuddha will be launching its range of pure products very soon, stay
                        tuned!</p>
